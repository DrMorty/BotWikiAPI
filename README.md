# BotWikiAPI
This is code for telegram bot which parses wikipedia pages and gives you summary of it 
First of all, we ask our user which page's language he want to see. I've made 11 languages, which are the most popular. 
But wikipedia library can found any pages at any languages. I suppose I'll try to make more languages
2 item of mine program - it's our request to name page. If their would be more than 1 page, app would stop and show list of pages to user
3 item - it's our parse to page and print first paragraph of it.
And if user make a mistake he can type no(or other words) and program would restart.
